3:T45f,**I am a pragmatic, solution-oriented, full-stack web developer.**  
<br />
I view software, frameworks, libraries, and packages as versatile tools to solve problems. I am not confined to a specific set of technologies; instead, I utilize whatever is necessary to address your challenges, implement new features, or support existing projects.
<br/>
I love tackling complex technical problems. While web development is my primary expertise and focus, I also have a strong passion for embedded software, hardware & PCB design, CAD, 3D printing, and now my latest educational challenge; conversion/DIY electric vehicles.
<br/>
My journey with technical challenges started at a young age, creating simple video games for my Nintendo DS. Now, after <span id="time">time</span> doing software development professionally, my passion for innovation and problem-solving remains as strong as ever. As showcased in my projects section in this portfolio, I still dedicate much of my free time to intricate and technical passion projects.
<br/>
This is the passion and energy that I bring to you and your team.

_~ Niek de Wit_4:T493,
At Alliander, together with a new team, I worked as a full-stack developer on an application which aids the registration and management of problems in the power grid. It was my responsibility to develop and maintain a custom front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/NestJS/Postgres).  

Initially, this software was deployed on an Openshift. For technical reasons related to an upcoming database migration, I took the lead in researching, planning and executing the migration of our deployment away from Openshift, to an AWS EKS cluster.  

Besides usual software feature implementations, one of the main challenges in this project, team and organisation in general, was a migration from a data architecture based on SAP HANA, to an architecture based on AWS-hosted databases. I take responsibility for technically leading the project and the team on a path forwards, away from SAP HANA, towards an architecture build around AWS.  

I worked closely with the product owner, key-users, solution architects and other developers. To find technical solutions and specific workable plans of action for the development of new features and software solutions more generally.

After SyncVR, I started working on a multiplayer e-sports game in Unity as a technical challenge for myself. I planned to finish and release this game on Steam, but never actually got around to finishing it.. maybe someday ;) It is playable though! This game is made in Unity using C# and the Photon Fusion service for the multiplayer component. I used machine learning (Unity ML-Agents) to train AI opponents for the game.  
During development of this game, performance/framerate has always been one of the highest priorities next to optimizing the architecture of the project for a high scalability/flexibility.  
Unity UI Toolkit was during the development of this proejct a relatively new feature introduced by Unity. In many ways it is similar to HTML/CSS/JS. However with many features still missing. Such as a good native support for component based UI work. So I managed to create a very minimalist Angular-like framework within my own project, which allows me to still work with a sort of UXML/USS/C# web-component system for my Unity project. This taught me even more about the internal workings of existing web frameworks like Angular and React.6:T5fa,At SyncVR, I was the lead web-developer. Here it was my main responsibility to develop and maintain a custom platform front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/Express) on Google Cloud Platform. Initially, this platform was used as an internal tool to manage healthcare institutions, leased VR devices and their available VR applications.  
Over time, this system transformed into a platform where healthcare professionals can log in to manage devices from a distance (mobile device management features). While app developers can log in to manage their apps and app versions/releases (app store features). This is a platform which I developed from scratch mostly on my own in the beginning. In the last half year, other developers joined the team to support the project.   
During my last period at SyncVR, I spent most of my time on refactoring the architecture of the platform to accommodate a switch from a NoSQL document database (Firestore) to a relational database (MySQL). With all the hurdles you can imagine for such a task. I took the responsibility upon myself to learn how to create a beautiful GraphQL implementation which could facilitate this complex migration. I must say, this turned me into a real GraphQL fanboy.  
Over the years at SyncVR, I worked closely with business developers, clients, designers and other developers. To specify functional and technical requirements for the platform. I also mentored several students to help make their VR applications performant, and delivered within the given deadline.7:T490,[Video of this project (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bvnTaET6kc)  
In between Targomo and SyncVR, I spent some months learning about embedded software and hardware development. I developed a custom gaming table from scratch. All details about those months are documented [in this blog post (Medium)](https://medium.com/p/790f07e41859).  
Results from this projects are ongoing in my spare time (although, admittedly, have not been able to give this project the commitment it deserves), and can be seen on [this repository (Github)](https://github.com/Arcadable)  
I designed a simple custom PCB using KiCad. Wrote a programming language [(ArcadableScript)](https://github.com/Arcadable/ArcadableVSCodeExtension) from scratch which can be executed as an interpreted language on a Teensy MCU. Or the ArcadableScript can be emulated on the development environment in a custom vsCode extension.  
The big (and fun) challenge about this project is the extremely low level performance optimization. Using 2 teensy MCU controllers in parallel to drive the custom built 42x42 led display, while also outputting audio and executing game logic without any hiccups.0:["--vn0PE0bo8--1XZhv5X0",[[["",{"children":["en",{"children":["skills",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["en",{"children":["skills",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","$L2",null,{"appState":{"language":"en","aboutMeText":"$3","labels":{"menu":{"projects":"Projects","about":"About","contact":"Contact","skills":"Skills","downloads":"Downloads"},"header":{"title":"de Wit Software","subtitle":"Full-stack development"},"time":{"year":"year","years":"years","month":"month","months":"months","day":"day","days":"days","hour":"hour","hours":"hours","minute":"minute","minutes":"minutes"},"date":{"january":"Jan.","february":"Feb.","march":"Mar.","april":"Apr.","may":"May.","june":"Jun.","july":"Jul.","august":"Aug.","september":"Sep.","october":"Oct.","november":"Nov.","december":"Dec.","now":"Ongoing"},"downloads":{"print":"Print my resume","download":"Download my resume (PDF)","source":"Source of this website"},"contact":{"linkedIn":"LinkedIn","phone":"Phone","email":"Email","github":"Github","address":"Address","taxNumber":"VAT number","kvkNumber":"KVK number","onRequest":"On request"},"projects":{"recommendation":{"letter":"Letter of recommendation","linkedin":"LinkedIn recommendation"},"type":{"work":"Professional project","personalProject":"Personal project"},"commitment":{"fullTime":"Full-time","onCall":"On call","partTime":"Part-time"},"remote":{"remote":"Remote","onLocation":"On-location"}},"and":"and"},"githubSource":"https://github.com/de-Wit-Software/portfolio-app","contactInfo":[{"label":"Email","value":"niek@dewitsoftware.nl","display":"email","displayData":"niek@dewitsoftware.nl"},{"label":"Github","value":"niek-dewit","display":"href","displayData":"https://github.com/niek-dewit"},{"label":"LinkedIn","value":"niekdewit","display":"href","displayData":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/niekdewit/"},{"label":"Address","value":"Montfoort, Utrecht, Netherlands","display":"plain"},{"label":"Phone","value":"On request","display":"plain"},{"label":"VAT number","value":"NL005090024B47","display":"plain"},{"label":"KVK number","value":"94525447","display":"plain"}],"projects":[{"company":"Express Me","function":"","start":"$D2024-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","end":"$D2024-08-09T11:38:09.335Z","type":"personal_project","commitment":"part_time","skills":["Android Native","Java","React Native","AWS","Typescript","RXJS/NGXS/NgRx","Postgres","Github Actions","Spring Boot"],"description":"Together with another developer, we are developing Express Me.
