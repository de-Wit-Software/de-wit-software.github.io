Wrote a programming language [(Arcadable"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Script)](https://github.com/Arcadable/ArcadableVSCodeExtension) from scratch which can be executed as an interpreted language on a Teensy MCU. Or the ArcadableScript can be emulated on the development environment in a custom vsCode extension.  \nThe big (and fun) challenge about this project is the extremely low level performance optimization. Using 2 teensy MCU controllers in parallel to drive the custom built 42x42 led display, while also outputting audio and executing game logic without any hiccups.11:T45f,**I am a pragmatic, solution-oriented, full-stack web developer.**  \n\u003cbr /\u003e\nI view software, frameworks, libraries, and packages as versatile tools to solve problems.

All details about those months are documented [in this blog post (Medium)](https://medium.com/p/790f07e41859).  \nResults from this projects are ongoing in my spare time (although, admittedly, have not been able to give this project the commitment it deserves), and can be seen on [this repository (Gi"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"thub)](https://github.com/Arcadable)  \nI designed a simple custom PCB using KiCad. Wrote a programming language [(ArcadableScript)](https://github.com/Arcadable/ArcadableVSCodeExtension) from scratch which can be executed as an interpreted language on a Teensy MCU. Or the ArcadableScript can be emulated on the development environment in a custom vsCode extension.  \nThe big (and fun) challenge about this project is the extremely low level performance optimization. Using 2 teensy MCU controllers in parallel to drive the custom built 42x42 led display, while also outputting audio and executing game logic without any hiccups.3c:[]\n39:{\"company\":\"Arcadable\",\"function\":\"\",\"start\":\"$D2019-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"end\":\"$D2020-04-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\"type\":\"personal_project\",\"commitment\":\"full_time\",\"skills\":\"$3a\",\"description\":\"$3b\",\"recommendations\":\"$3c\"}\n3e:[\"Angular V2+\",\"RXJS/NGXS/NgRx\",\"Node.js\",\"Express.js\",\"Typescript\",\"Javascript\",\"Stripe\",\"Dynamic web maps\",\"HUGO\"]\n40:{\"description\":\"Copy available on request\",\"type\":\"letter\",\"name\":\"Henning Hollburg\",\"position\":\"CEO at Targomo\",\"date\":\"$D2019-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\"}\n41:{\"description\":\"_“I've had the pleasure of working with Niek as the Product Manager of his software development work at Targomo.
