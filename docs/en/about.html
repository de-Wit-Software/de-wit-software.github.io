I planned to finish and release this game on Steam, but never actually got around to finishing it.. maybe someday ;) It is playable though! This game is made in Unity using C# and the Photon Fusion service for the multiplayer component.

In many ways it is similar to HTML/CSS/JS. However with many features still missing. Such as a good native support for component based UI work. So I managed to create a very minimalist Angular-like framework within my own project, which allows me to still work with a sort of UXML/USS/C# web-component system for my Unity project.

Here it was my main responsibility to develop and maintain a custom platform front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/Express) on Google Cloud Platform. Initially, this platform was used as an internal tool to manage healthcare institutions, leased VR devices and their available VR applications.  \nOver time, this system transformed into a platform where healthcare professionals can log in to manage devices from a distance (mobile device management features). While app developers can log in to manage their apps and app versions/releases (app store features). This is a platform which I developed from scratch mostly on my own in the beginning. In the last half year, other developers joined the team to support the project.   \nDuring my last period at SyncVR, I spent most of my time on refactoring the architecture of the platform to accommodate a switch from a NoSQL document database (Firestore) to a relational database (MySQL). With all the hurdles you can imagine for such a task. I took the responsibility upon myself to learn how to create a beautiful GraphQL implementation which could facilitate this complex migration. I must say, this turned me into a real GraphQL fanboy.  \nOver the years at SyncVR, I worked closely with business developers, clients, designers and other developers. To specify functional and technical requirements for the platform. I also mentored several students to help make their VR applications performant, and delivered within the given deadline.ad:{\"description\":\"_\\\"I really enjoyed working intensively with Niek for almost seven months.
