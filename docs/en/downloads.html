I take responsibility for technically leading the project and the team on a path forwards, away from SAP HANA, towards an architecture build around AWS.  \n\nI worked closely with the product owner, key-users, solution architects and other developers. To find technical solutions and specific workable plans of action for the development of new features and software solutions more generally.  \nb:T518,[Video of this project (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U0W0g_EiDo), [Link to the game (itch.io)](https://hmmmmniek.itch.io/buddyball)  \nAfter SyncVR, I started working on a multiplayer e-sports game in Unity as a technical challenge for myself.

Here it was my main responsibility to develop and maintain a custom platform front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/Express) on Google Cloud Platform. Initially, this platform was used as an internal tool to manage healthcare institutions, leased VR devices and their available VR applications.  \nOver time, this system transformed into a platform where healthcare professionals can log in to manage devices from a distance (mobile device management features). While app developers can log in to manage their apps and app versions/releases (app store features).

In the last half year, other developers joined the team to support the project.   \nDuring my last period at SyncVR, I spent most of my time on refactoring the architecture of the platform to accommodate a switch from a NoSQL document database (Firestore) to a relational database (MySQL). With all the hurdles you can imagine for such a task. I took the responsibility upon myself to learn how to create a beautiful GraphQL implementation which could facilitate this complex migration. I must say, this turned me into a real GraphQL fanboy.  \nOver the years at SyncVR, I worked closely with business developers, clients, designers and other developers. To specify functional and technical requirements for the platform. I also mentored several students to help make their VR applications performant, and delivered within the given deadline.e:T490,[Video of this project (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bvnTaET6kc)  \nIn between Targomo and SyncVR, I spent some months learning about embedded software and hardware development.

Wrote a programming language [(ArcadableScript)](https://github.com/Arcadable/ArcadableVSCodeExtension) from scratch which can be executed as an interpreted language on a Teensy MCU. Or the ArcadableScript can be emulated on the development environment in a custom vsCode extension.  \nThe big (and fun) challenge about this project is the extremely low level performance optimization. Using 2 teensy MCU controllers in parallel to drive the custom built 42x42 led display, while also outputting audio and executing game logic without any hiccups.12:{\"projects\":\"Projects\",\"about\":\"About me\",\"contact\":\"Contact\",\"skills\":\"Skills\",\"downloads\":\"Downloads\"}\n13:{\"title\":\"de Wit Software\",\"subtitle\":\"Full-stack development\"}\n14:{\"year\":\"year\",\"years\":\"years\",\"month\":\"month\",\"months\":\"months\",\"day\":\"day\",\"days\":\"days\",\"hour\":\"hour\",\"hours\":\"hours\",\"minute\":\"minute\",\"minutes\":\"minutes\"}\n15:{\"january\":\"Jan.\",\"february\":\"Feb.\",\"march\":\"Mar.\",\"april\":\"Apr.\",\"may\":\"May.\",\"june\":\"Jun.\",\"july\":\"Jul.\",\"august\":\"Aug.\",\"september\":\"Sep.\",\"october\":\"Oct.\",\"november\":\"Nov.\",\"december\":\"Dec.\",\"now\":\"Ongoing\"}\n16:{\"print\":\"Print my resume\",\"download\":\"Download my resume (PDF)\",\"source\":\"Source of this website\"}\n17:{\"linkedIn\":\"LinkedIn\",\"phone\":\"Phone\",\"email\":\"Email\",\"github\":\"Github\",\"address\":\"Address\",\"taxNumber\":\"VAT number\",\"kvkNumber\":\"KVK number\",\"onRequest\":\"On request\"}\n19:{\"letter\":\"Letter of recommendation\",\"linkedin\":\"LinkedIn recommendat"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ion\"}\n1a:{\"work\":\"Professional project\",\"personalProject\":\"Personal project\"}\n1b:{\"fullTime\":\"Full-time\",\"onCall\":\"On call\",\"partTime\":\"Part-time\"}\n1c:{\"remote\":\"Remote\",\"onLocation\":\"On-location\"}\n18:{\"recommendation\":\"$19\",\"type\":\"$1a\",\"commitment\":\"$1b\",\"remote\":\"$1c\"}\n11:{\"menu\":\"$12\",\"header\":\"$13\",\"time\":\"$14\",\"date\":\"$15\",\"downloads\":\"$16\",\"contact\":\"$17\",\"projects\":\"$18\",\"and\":\"and\"}\n21:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[[[\"$\",\"link\",\"0\",{\"rel\":\"stylesheet\",\"href\":\"/_next/static/css/21da4f3f8d6ac1ef.css\",\"precedence\":\"next\",\"crossOrigin\":\"$undefined\"}]],[\"$\",\"$L6\",null,{\"buildId\":\"dNn5ZNNX9IKFRiDG6xbzJ\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"initialCanonicalUrl\":\"/en/downloads\",\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"en\",{\"children\":[\"downloads\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"en\",{\"children\":[\"downloads\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L7\",[\"$\",\"$L8\",null,{\"appState\":{\"language\":\"en\",\"aboutMeText\":\"$9\",\"aboutMeShortText\":\"I am a versatile full-stack web developer with a pragmatic, solution-oriented approach.
