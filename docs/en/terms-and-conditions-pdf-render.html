<li><strong>Client</strong>: the natural person or legal entity that has commissioned the Contractor to perform work</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: all work commissioned, or work resulting from, or directly related to the commission</li>
<li><strong>Agreement</strong>: any arrangement between Client and Contractor for the performance of Work by Contractor for Client</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Applicability</h2>
<ol>
<li>These General Terms and Conditions apply to all offers, quotations, and Agreements between Contractor and Client.</li>
<li>Deviations from these General Terms and Conditions are only valid if explicitly agreed upon in writing.</li>
<li>The applicability of any purchasing or other conditions of the Client is explicitly rejected.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3. Quotations and Offers</h2>
<ol>
<li>All quotations and offers from Contractor are non-binding unless a deadline for acceptance is specified in the quotation.</li>
<li>Quotations are valid for 30 days unless otherwise indicated.</li>
<li>If a quotation is marked as &quot;indicative,&quot; it should only be considered as a guideline price and no rights can be derived from it.</li>
<li>Contractor cannot be held to their quotations if Client can reasonably understand that the quotation contains an obvious mistake or error.</li>
</ol>
<h2>4. Formation of the Agreement</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Agreement is formed when the quotation or order confirmation signed by both Contractor and Client has been received back by Contractor.</li>
<li>If the assignment is given verbally, or if the signed quotation or order confirmation has not yet been received back, the assignment is deemed to have been established under these General Terms and Conditions when Contractor has started the execution of the assignment at Client&#x27;s request.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5. Execution of the Agreement</h2>
<ol>
<li>Contractor will execute the Agreement to the best of their insight and ability and in accordance with the requirements of good workmanship.</li>
<li>If Contractor deems it necessary to involve third parties for the execution of certain work, this will first be discussed with Client. After mutual approval, Contractor has the right to have this work performed by the discussed third parties.</li>
<li>Contractor has the right to execute the Agreement in different phases. Invoicing will take place per phase for the work performed in that phase.</li>
<li>If the Agreement is executed in phases, Contractor may suspend the execution of components belonging to a subsequent phase until Client has approved the results of the preceding phase in writing.</li>
<li>Client ensures that all data and materials, which Contractor indicates are necessary for executing the Agreement, are provided in a timely manner.</li>
<li>If the required data for the execution of the Agreement is not provided on time, Contractor has the right to suspend the execution of the Agreement.</li>
<li>Client ensures timely access to all systems, including cloud environments, necessary for performing the Work. When setting up new systems, Contractor maintains the necessary access rights for performing the Work.</li>
</ol>
<h2>6. Acceptance and Testing</h2>
<ol>
<li>After delivery of (a phase of) the project, Client is obliged to test the delivered work and provide feedback to Contractor within 10 working days.</li>
<li>If Client does not provide feedback within this period, the delivered work is deemed to have been accepted.</li>
<li>Feedback must be provided in writing and with sufficient detail.</li>
<li>Contractor will assess the received feedback and, if justified, process it according to the original specifications.</li>
<li>Minor errors that do not prevent the operational or productive use of the software are not grounds for withholding acceptance.</li>

<ol>
<li>All prices used by Contractor are:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive of VAT</li>
<li>Inclusive of shipping, travel, accommodation, and other expenses, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing</li>

<li>Invoicing takes place monthly for work performed and costs incurred in that month.</li>
<li>Payment must be made within 14 days after the invoice date.</li>
<li>If Client fails to make timely payment, Client is legally in default. Client then owes the statutory commercial interest in accordance with Article 6:119a of the Dutch Civil Code. Interest on the due amount will be calculated from the moment Client is in default until the moment of payment of the full amount due.</li>
<li>In case of liquidation, bankruptcy, or suspension of payment of Client, Contractor&#x27;s claims are immediately due and payable.</li>
<li>Contractor has the right to suspend the execution of the Agreement if an invoice is not paid within the payment term.</li>

<li>Changes to the Agreement and additional work must be agreed upon in writing.</li>
<li>Without being in default, Contractor may refuse a request to modify the Agreement.</li>
<li>If the modification or supplement to the Agreement will have financial and/or qualitative consequences, Contractor will inform Client about this in advance.</li>
<li>If a fixed fee has been agreed upon, Contractor will indicate to what extent the modification or supplement to the Agreement will result in an excess of this fee.</li>
</ol>
<h2>9. Limitations and Responsibilities</h2>

<h2>14. Termination</h2>
