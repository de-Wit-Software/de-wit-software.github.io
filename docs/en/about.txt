_~ Niek de Wit_4:T493,
At Alliander, together with a new team, I worked as a full-stack developer on an application which aids the registration and management of problems in the power grid. It was my responsibility to develop and maintain a custom front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/NestJS/Postgres).  

Initially, this software was deployed on an Openshift. For technical reasons related to an upcoming database migration, I took the lead in researching, planning and executing the migration of our deployment away from Openshift, to an AWS EKS cluster.  

Besides usual software feature implementations, one of the main challenges in this project, team and organisation in general, was a migration from a data architecture based on SAP HANA, to an architecture based on AWS-hosted databases. I take responsibility for technically leading the project and the team on a path forwards, away from SAP HANA, towards an architecture build around AWS.  

I worked closely with the product owner, key-users, solution architects and other developers. To find technical solutions and specific workable plans of action for the development of new features and software solutions more generally.  
5:T5fa,At SyncVR, I was the lead web-developer. Here it was my main responsibility to develop and maintain a custom platform front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/Express) on Google Cloud Platform. Initially, this platform was used as an internal tool to manage healthcare institutions, leased VR devices and their available VR applications.  
Over time, this system transformed into a platform where healthcare professionals can log in to manage devices from a distance (mobile device management features). While app developers can log in to manage their apps and app versions/releases (app store features). This is a platform which I developed from scratch mostly on my own in the beginning. In the last half year, other developers joined the team to support the project.   
During my last period at SyncVR, I spent most of my time on refactoring the architecture of the platform to accommodate a switch from a NoSQL document database (Firestore) to a relational database (MySQL). With all the hurdles you can imagine for such a task. I took the responsibility upon myself to learn how to create a beautiful GraphQL implementation which could facilitate this complex migration. I must say, this turned me into a real GraphQL fanboy.  
Over the years at SyncVR, I worked closely with business developers, clients, designers and other developers. To specify functional and technical requirements for the platform. I also mentored several students to help make their VR applications performant, and delivered within the given deadline.6:T493,

This is [my winning submission](https://itch.io/jam/back-to-school-multiplayer-game-jam-2022/rate/1745917) of the Back to School Multiplayer Game Jam 2022, under the category "Best competitive Gameplay".  
After SyncVR, I started working on a multiplayer e-sports game in Unity as a technical challenge for myself. I planned to finish and release this game on Steam, but never actually got around to finishing it.. maybe someday ;) It is playable though! This game is made in Unity using C# and the Photon Fusion service for the multiplayer component. I used machine learning (Unity ML-Agents) to train AI opponents for the game.  
During development of this game, performance/framerate has always been one of the highest priorities next to optimizing the architecture of the project for a high scalability/flexibility.  
Unity UI Toolkit was during the development of this proejct a relatively new feature introduced by Unity. In many ways it is similar to HTML/CSS/JS. However with many features still missing. Such as a good native support for component based UI work. So I managed to create a very minimalist Angular-like framework within my own project, which allows me to still work with a sort of UXML/USS/C# web-component system for my Unity project. This taught me even more about the internal workings of existing web frameworks like Angular and React.9:T490,[Video of this project (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bvnTaET6kc)  
In between Targomo and SyncVR, I spent some months learning about embedded software and hardware development. I developed a custom gaming table from scratch. All details about those months are documented [in this blog post (Medium)](https://medium.com/p/790f07e41859).  
Results from this projects are ongoing in my spare time (although, admittedly, have not been able to give this project the commitment it deserves), and can be seen on [this repository (Github)](https://github.com/Arcadable)  
I designed a simple custom PCB using KiCad. Wrote a programming language [(ArcadableScript)](https://github.com/Arcadable/ArcadableVSCodeExtension) from scratch which can be executed as an interpreted language on a Teensy MCU. Or the ArcadableScript can be emulated on the development environment in a custom vsCode extension.  
The big (and fun) challenge about this project is the extremely low level performance optimization. Using 2 teensy MCU controllers in parallel to drive the custom built 42x42 led display, while also outputting audio and executing game logic without any hiccups.a:T493,

32:T493,
At Alliander, together with a new team, I worked as a full-stack developer on an application which aids the registration and management of problems in the power grid. It was my responsibility to develop and maintain a custom front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/NestJS/Postgres).  

Initially, this software was deployed on an Openshift. For technical reasons related to an upcoming database migration, I took the lead in researching, planning and executing the migration of our deployment away from Openshift, to an AWS EKS cluster.  

Besides usual software feature implementations, one of the main challenges in this project, team and organisation in general, was a migration from a data architecture based on SAP HANA, to an architecture based on AWS-hosted databases. I take responsibility for technically leading the project and the team on a path forwards, away from SAP HANA, towards an architecture build around AWS.  

I worked closely with the product owner, key-users, solution architects and other developers. To find technical solutions and specific workable plans of action for the development of new features and software solutions more generally.

3d:T5fa,At SyncVR, I was the lead web-developer. Here it was my main responsibility to develop and maintain a custom platform front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/Express) on Google Cloud Platform. Initially, this platform was used as an internal tool to manage healthcare institutions, leased VR devices and their available VR applications.  
Over time, this system transformed into a platform where healthcare professionals can log in to manage devices from a distance (mobile device management features). While app developers can log in to manage their apps and app versions/releases (app store features). This is a platform which I developed from scratch mostly on my own in the beginning. In the last half year, other developers joined the team to support the project.   
During my last period at SyncVR, I spent most of my time on refactoring the architecture of the platform to accommodate a switch from a NoSQL document database (Firestore) to a relational database (MySQL). With all the hurdles you can imagine for such a task. I took the responsibility upon myself to learn how to create a beautiful GraphQL implementation which could facilitate this complex migration. I must say, this turned me into a real GraphQL fanboy.  
Over the years at SyncVR, I worked closely with business developers, clients, designers and other developers. To specify functional and technical requirements for the platform. I also mentored several students to help make their VR applications performant, and delivered within the given deadline.3f:{"description":"_\"I really enjoyed working intensively with Niek for almost seven months.

74:T5e6,[Video of this project (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U0W0g_EiDo), [Link to the game (itch.io)](https://hmmmmniek.itch.io/buddyball)  
This is [my winning submission](https://itch.io/jam/back-to-school-multiplayer-game-jam-2022/rate/1745917) of the Back to School Multiplayer Game Jam 2022, under the category "Best competitive Gameplay".  
After SyncVR, I started working on a multiplayer e-sports game in Unity as a technical challenge for myself. I planned to finish and release this game on Steam, but never actually got around to finishing it.. maybe someday ;) It is playable though! This game is made in Unity using C# and the Photon Fusion service for the multiplayer component. I used machine learning (Unity ML-Agents) to train AI opponents for the game.  
During development of this game, performance/framerate has always been one of the highest priorities next to optimizing the architecture of the project for a high scalability/flexibility.  
Unity UI Toolkit was during the development of this proejct a relatively new feature introduced by Unity. In many ways it is similar to HTML/CSS/JS. However with many features still missing. Such as a good native support for component based UI work.

I designed a simple custom PCB using KiCad.

Or the ArcadableScript can be emulated on the development environment in a custom vsCode extension.

At Alliander, together with a new team, I worked as a full-stack developer on an application which aids the registration and management of problems in the power grid. It was my responsibility to develop and maintain a custom front-end (Angular) and backend (Node.js/NestJS/Postgres).  

Initially, this software was deployed on an Openshift. For technical reasons related to an upcoming database migration, I took the lead in researching, planning and executing the migration of our deployment away from Openshift, to an AWS EKS cluster.  

Besides usual software feature implementations, one of the main challenges in this project, team and organisation in general, was a migration from a data architecture based on SAP HANA, to an architecture based on AWS-hosted databases. I take responsibility for technically leading the project and the team on a path forwards, away from SAP HANA, towards an architecture build around AWS.  

I worked closely with the product owner, key-users, solution architects and other developers. To find technical solutions and specific workable plans of action for the development of new features and software solutions more generally.

After SyncVR, I started working on a multiplayer e-sports game in Unity as a technical challenge for myself. I planned to finish and release this game on Steam, but never actually got around to finishing it.. maybe someday ;) It is playable though! This game is made in Unity using C# and the Photon Fusion service for the multiplayer component. I used machine learning (Unity ML-Agents) to train AI opponents for the game.  
During development of this game, performance/framerate has always been one of the highest priorities next to optimizing the architecture of the project for a high scalability/flexibility.  
Unity UI Toolkit was during the development of this proejct a relatively new feature introduced by Unity. In many ways it is similar to HTML/CSS/JS. However with many features still missing. Such as a good native support for component based UI work. So I managed to create a very minimalist Angular-like framework within my own project, which allows me to still work with a sort of UXML/USS/C# web-component system for my Unity project.

## 1. Definitions

In these General Terms and Conditions, the following terms are defined as:

- **Contractor**: de Wit Software, sole proprietorship, located at Wilhelminaplein 15, 3417AE, Montfoort, Chamber of Commerce number 94525447, VAT number NL005090024B47
- **Client**: the natural person or legal entity that has commissioned the Contractor to perform work
- **Work**: all work commissioned, or work resulting from, or directly related to the commission
- **Agreement**: any arrangement between Client and Contractor for the performance of Work by Contractor for Client

## 2. Applicability

1. These General Terms and Conditions apply to all offers, quotations, and Agreements between Contractor and Client.
2. Deviations from these General Terms and Conditions are only valid if explicitly agreed upon in writing.
3. The applicability of any purchasing or other conditions of the Client is explicitly rejected.

## 3. Quotations and Offers

1. All quotations and offers from Contractor are non-binding unless a deadline for acceptance is specified in the quotation.
2. Quotations are valid for 30 days unless otherwise indicated.
3. If a quotation is marked as "indicative," it should only be considered as a guideline price and no rights can be derived from it.
4. Contractor cannot be held to their quotations if Client can reasonably understand that the quotation contains an obvious mistake or error.

## 4. Formation of the Agreement

1. The Agreement is formed when the quotation or order confirmation signed by both Contractor and Client has been received back by Contractor.
2. If the assignment is given verbally, or if the signed quotation or order confirmation has not yet been received back, the assignment is deemed to have been established under these General Terms and Conditions when Contractor has started the execution of the assignment at Client's request.

## 5. Execution of the Agreement

1. Contractor will execute the Agreement to the best of their insight and ability and in accordance with the requirements of good workmanship.
2. If Contractor deems it necessary to involve third parties for the execution of certain work, this will first be discussed with Client. After mutual approval, Contractor has the right to have this work performed by the discussed third parties.
3. Contractor has the right to execute the Agreement in different phases. Invoicing will take place per phase for the work performed in that phase.
4. If the Agreement is executed in phases, Contractor may suspend the execution of components belonging to a subsequent phase until Client has approved the results of the preceding phase in writing.
5. Client ensures that all data and materials, which Contractor indicates are necessary for executing the Agreement, are provided in a timely manner.
6. If the required data for the execution of the Agreement is not provided on time, Contractor has the right to suspend the execution of the Agreement.
7. Client ensures timely access to all systems, including cloud environments, necessary for performing the Work. When setting up new systems, Contractor maintains the necessary access rights for performing the Work.

## 6. Acceptance and Testing

1. After delivery of (a phase of) the project, Client is obliged to test the delivered work and provide feedback to Contractor within 10 working days.
2. If Client does not provide feedback within this period, the delivered work is deemed to have been accepted.
3. Feedback must be provided in writing and with sufficient detail.
4. Contractor will assess the received feedback and, if justified, process it according to the original specifications.
5. Minor errors that do not prevent the operational or productive use of the software are not grounds for withholding acceptance.

  - Exclusive of VAT
  - Inclusive of shipping, travel, accommodation, and other expenses, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing
2. The fee is calculated according to Contractor's usual rates.
3. Invoicing takes place monthly for work performed and costs incurred in that month.
4. Payment must be made within 14 days after the invoice date.
5. If Client fails to make timely payment, Client is legally in default. Client then owes the statutory commercial interest in accordance with Article 6:119a of the Dutch Civil Code. Interest on the due amount will be calculated from the moment Client is in default until the moment of payment of the full amount due.
6. In case of liquidation, bankruptcy, or suspension of payment of Client, Contractor's claims are immediately due and payable.
7. Contractor has the right to suspend the execution of the Agreement if an invoice is not paid within the payment term.
8. Costs for the use of cloud services, licenses, or other third-party services are directly charged to Client, unless agreed otherwise in writing.

## 8. Modification of the Agreement and Additional Work

1. If during the execution of the Agreement it appears necessary to modify or supplement the work to be performed, parties will timely adjust the Agreement accordingly through mutual consultation.
2. Changes to the Agreement and additional work must be agreed upon in writing.
3. Without being in default, Contractor may refuse a request to modify the Agreement.
4. If the modification or supplement to the Agreement will have financial and/or qualitative consequences, Contractor will inform Client about this in advance.
5. If a fixed fee has been agreed upon, Contractor will indicate to what extent the modification or supplement to the Agreement will result in an excess of this fee.

## 9. Limitations and Responsibilities

1. Contractor will make best efforts to develop the software according to the written agreed specifications. This constitutes a best-efforts obligation, not a results obligation.

2. Client acknowledges that:
  - Software development is an iterative process
  - Finding and fixing errors is a normal part of software development
  - All work after delivery, including fixing errors and implementing improvements, is considered new assignments subject to Contractor's usual rates

  - After concluding the Agreement, circumstances come to Contractor's knowledge giving good reason to fear that Client will not fulfill their obligations
  - Client was requested to provide security for the fulfillment of their obligations under the Agreement and this security is not provided or is insufficient

## 14. Termination

1. Both parties can terminate the Agreement in writing at any time with a notice period of one month.
2. In case of early termination, Contractor is entitled to compensation for resulting capacity loss, unless facts and circumstances underlying the termination are attributable to Contractor.
