I developed a custom gaming table from scratch. All details about those months are documented [in this blog post (Medium)](https://medium.com/p/790f07e41859).  \nResults from this projects are ongoing in my spare time (although, admittedly, have not been able to give this project the commitment it deserves), and can be seen on [this repository (Github)](https://github.com/Arcadable)  \nI designed a simple custom PCB using KiCad. Wrote a programming language [(ArcadableScript)](https://github.com/Arcadable/ArcadableVSCodeExtension) from scratch which can be executed as an interpreted language on a Teensy MCU. Or the ArcadableScript can be emulated on the development environment in a custom vsCode extension.  \nThe big (and fun) challenge about this project is the extremely low level performance optimization. Using 2 teensy MCU controllers in parallel to drive the custom built 42x42 led display, while also outputting audio and executing game logic without any hiccups.16:[\"Angular V2+\",\"AWS\",\"GraphQL\",\"RESTful\",\"Typescript\",\"Node.js\",\"CI/CD\",\"Docker\",\"Kubernetes\"]\n1e:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[[[\"$\",\"link\",\"0\",{\"rel\":\"stylesheet\",\"href\":\"/_next/static/css/a46ba0a09a924538.css\",\"precedence\":\"next\",\"crossOrigin\":\"$undefined\"}]],[\"$\",\"$L6\",null,{\"buildId\":\"qDJ3yq8JQVQK2lc1oRlle\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"initialCanonicalUrl\":\"/en/skills\",\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"en\",{\"children\":[\"skills\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"en\",{\"children\":[\"skills\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L7\",[\"$\",\"$L8\",null,{\"appState\":{\"language\":\"en\",\"aboutMeText\":\"$9\",\"aboutMeShortText\":{\"resume-fullstack-web\":\"I am a versatile full-stack web developer with a pragmatic, solution-oriented approach.
